Background:  
In Northern Scandinavia, during the summer months, the sun never really settles. However, during Winter, the sun is hardly seen. Set in present day, a snowmobile driver is stranded within the dense forest, with nothing more than a few basic tools in the pack. Night is quickly approaching, strange lights could be seen in the far away distance and both the mobile phone and his emergency radio gives nothing but static. Something has happened, at the same time that his snowmobile went dead but what?

- Survive in the harsh environments of Northern Sweden, Norway and Finland.
- Gather supplies, build a shelter, make a decision to try and wait for rescue (with the possibility to have to spend the winter outside) or make a run for it
- Learn from your mistakes and practice your trades but be wary. Don't spend all your energy trying to build a perfect cabin, when food are scarce and dangers lurks all around.
