## About me, Thimmy "Shaw" Stenlund

Born in a simple home a warm june night.... nah, we are not going that deep. 

### Early Career

After graduating from the Swedish "Gymnasium", after three years of studies connected to construction and business, I opted to work two years in the care system. It gave a good moral compass and a sense of pride from doing hard work. My second sector was to start my own company: a computer store. I ran it for the bigger part of a year, ending on a monthly positive balance. (Something I am very proud of) However, things was about to change.

### Next step

The rent was about to go up three-fold and so I decided to find work elsewhere. Hence, my career in Technical Support and Customer Service began. Fastforwarding, being employed both at IBM and Google (in Dublin, Ireland), I decided to move back home to Skellefteå, in the northern regions of Sweden. I found a job as a technical support for a company I've worked for before but yet again would things take an unexpectant turn.

### New horizons

A callback from a previous work application (about 8 months afterwards...) made it so that I ended up where I am today - a software developer and test engineer at a large multinational company. Every day there's something new to learn and something old to fix, but it's how I like it. Combine that with a beautiful wife, two bonuskids every other week and studying at full speed - my life is hectic, sometimes hard, but I wouldn´t have it any other way.
