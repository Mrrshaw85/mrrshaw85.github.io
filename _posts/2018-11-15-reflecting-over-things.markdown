#### What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
- Compare to regular CSS
- Which techniques did you use?
- Pros and cons?

##### Answer:
I find the process of working with SASS quite handy. Importing the partials, adding variables and working that way seems to be a more refined way than the old CSS "rotation". The Pros with doing this, apart from what is already written, would be it's way of structure. It feels to a step above the normal CSS code, even though CSS is coming closer and closer to functioning well without the use of pre-processors. If I am to mention a Con, I would say that there's more files and structuring to keep an eye on, however how the example of Minima SASS is setup, it feels very close to the way I worked with CSS before (in its structuring).

#### What do you think of static site generators and what type of projects are they suitable for?

##### Answer: 
I haven't really worked with them before, I've always done my pages with pure code (html + css). Hence, the wonders of seeing it now. I really enjoy it (after the initial setup went through). It seems to be mainly suited for blogs, technical pages but really anything using a lot of static elements, with a desire to be run quickly and smoothly. I like it.

#### What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

##### Answer:
robots.txt is, in short, used by "spiders" (example: search engines). It can set it to either allow or disallow all or certain spiders to get information from the webpage. Good to note is that it doesn't stop indexing, as its a different process.  I currently have it configured to allow all "crawling" (the name of the process that the spiders performs.)
