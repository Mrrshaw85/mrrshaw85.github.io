**CSS Preprocessors**
I will sure continue to work with CSS Preprocessors now that I'm getting a hang of it. Fact is, I might publish a new blog about how I manage to work fulltime, study fulltime, being married and having kids every other week - without neglecting any of it! Phew, it can be a struggle though but my lovely family is always supporting me and giving me energy. Now, if I only could get the Open Graph Protocol to work as planned....
