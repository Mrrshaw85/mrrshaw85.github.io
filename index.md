## Welcome to Shaw's Tech Blog

*The science of today is the technology of tomorrow* - Edward Teller

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### May the odds ever be in your favor

So, this is the beginning of my tech blog. There will be regular blogposts in the "Blog" section, 
you can read all about me in the "About" page and see what I'm up to in the "Projects" section.

I wish you a grand day and remember - the first line of code is always the hardest. Cya!
